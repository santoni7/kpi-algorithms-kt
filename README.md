# kpi-algorithms-kt
Kotlin implementation of some algorithms/data structures

## 1. Insertion sort. 

Modified algorithm of insertion sort which arranges an integer array in this order:
At first all even elements go in ascending order, after them all odd elements in descending order.

## 2. Merge sort. Inversion count

Use merge sort algorithm to efficiently count inversions in an array

## 3. QuickSort. 

Compares quicksort variations of selecting pivot element/value by array element comparsions count. Runs on multiple threads.

## 4. Median Heap

Find median in array while reading it by one element. Uses Heap structure so complexity of insertion, deletion is O(log(N)). Median find complexity is O(1)

## 5. Hash tables

Comparsion of hash tables and hash functions:
1. Open address vs chaining collision resolution methods comparsion
2. Hash function comparsion: JVM HashCode vs Pseudo-random vs simple modulo
